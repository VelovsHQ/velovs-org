### Color Usage & Hierarchy
To maintain consistency, the colors should be applied according to the following hierarchy:

* **Backgrounds:** Use `Soft Ivory` for all primary light backgrounds to create a clean and spacious feel. `Charcoal Gray` can be used for dark-themed sections.
* **Text:** All primary body text and headings should use `Charcoal Gray` for maximum readability.
* **Primary Branding:** `Prestige Blue` should be used for major branding elements, such as hero sections, header backgrounds, or key informational components.
* **Calls-to-Action (CTAs):** `Signal Blue` is reserved for primary CTAs like "Get Started" or "Subscribe" buttons, as well as important icons, to draw the user's attention.
* **Secondary Elements:** `Slate Blue` can be used for secondary buttons, borders, blockquotes, or subtle highlights where a touch of color is needed without competing with the primary accents.

By adhering to these guidelines, we will ensure the Velovs brand remains visually consistent, professional, and instantly recognizable.
