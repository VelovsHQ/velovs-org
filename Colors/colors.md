## Core Palette

Our palette consists of five core colors that create a balanced and professional visual system.

### 1. Deep Emerald Green
- **Hex:** `#2D6A4F`
- **Role:** Primary Brand Color
- **Rationale:** Green is intrinsically linked to money, growth, and stability. This deep, luxurious emerald is a premium shade that conveys wealth and prosperity. It's sophisticated and calming, building confidence and aligning perfectly with the "performance" and "trust" aspects of the Velovs brand.

### 2. Rich Gold
- **Hex:** `#D4AF37`
- **Role:** Primary Accent
- **Rationale:** Gold is the quintessential color for luxury, success, and prestige. This confident shade should be used as a primary accent for key calls-to-action (buttons), highlights, and icons to create a high-value, premium feel.

### 3. Slate Blue
- **Hex:** `#4B5D67`
- **Role:** Secondary Accent / Supporting Color
- **Rationale:** This muted, intelligent blue adds a layer of professionalism and calm authority. It serves as a secondary accent that provides visual contrast without clashing with our primary colors. It signals security, intelligence, and corporate integrity.

### 4. Charcoal Gray
- **Hex:** `#1F1F1F`
- **Role:** Text & Dark Neutral
- **Rationale:** Serving as our dark neutral base, this charcoal is more sophisticated than pure black. It communicates seriousness and timeless elegance, ensuring text is powerful and highly readable.

### 5. Soft Ivory
- **Hex:** `#F5F5F2`
- **Role:** Background & Light Neutral
- **Rationale:** This clean, warm off-white provides the perfect canvas to let our primary and accent colors stand out. It creates a breathable, premium, and minimalist atmosphere that feels more luxurious than stark white.

## Color Usage & Hierarchy

To maintain consistency, the colors should be applied according to the following hierarchy:

-   **Backgrounds:** Use **Soft Ivory** for all primary light backgrounds to create a clean and spacious feel. **Charcoal Gray** can be used for dark-themed sections.
-   **Text:** All primary body text and headings should use **Charcoal Gray** for maximum readability.
-   **Primary Branding:** **Deep Emerald Green** should be used for major branding elements, such as hero sections, header backgrounds, or key informational components.
-   **Calls-to-Action (CTAs):** **Rich Gold** is reserved for primary CTAs like "Get Started" or "Subscribe" buttons, as well as important icons, to draw the user's attention.
-   **Secondary Elements:** **Slate Blue** can be used for secondary buttons, borders, blockquotes, or subtle highlights where a touch of color is needed without competing with the primary accents.

By adhering to these guidelines, we will ensure the Velovs brand remains visually consistent, professional, and instantly recognizable.
